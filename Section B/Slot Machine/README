The application in question is a custom random number generator,
that operates similarly to a slot machine, with certain aspects that can and cannot be controlled.
The application is designed to provide users with a range of random numbers within a specified
range, with the added option of selecting the number of random numbers to be generated.

Upon launching the application, users are presented with a user-friendly graphical user interface
(GUI), designed using the JFrame component. The interface prompts users to enter a start and end
range, defining the range within which the random numbers will be generated.
Additionally, users are prompted to enter the number of random numbers they wish to generate.

The application incorporates several technical features to enhance user experience and prevent
errors. One such feature is the use of exception handling to prevent users from entering
non-numeric values. In the event that a user does enter a non-numeric value, a prompt will
appear, asking if they wish to continue using the application.

This custom random number generator provides users with a simple yet effective tool for
generating random numbers within specific ranges. The incorporation of technical features
ensures that users have a seamless experience while using the application, making
it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly random number
generator.
